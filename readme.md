The project talks about using Python to analyze data from Zomato, a food delivery and restaurant review platform. The goal is to answer some important questions like:

1. **Online vs Offline Delivery:** Are there more restaurants that offer online delivery, or is it mostly offline services?
2. **Popular Restaurants:** What types of restaurants do most people like the most?
3. **Price Preferences:** What price range do couples prefer when they go out to eat?

By analyzing the data, the project aims to help restaurant owners and businesses make smarter decisions based on what customers prefer.
